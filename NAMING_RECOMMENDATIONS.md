# Application Naming Recommendations

*Research conducted: 2025-11-11*

## Executive Summary

Based on extensive research of the application's features and internet uniqueness checks, we recommend renaming "Academic Explorer" to better differentiate it in the market. The top recommendations are **CitationMesh** or **ScholarWeave**.

## Application Context

Academic Explorer is a TypeScript-based research platform that provides:
- Interactive knowledge graph visualizations of academic literature

- **OpenNexus** - Open + connection point concept

## Recommended Action Steps

1. **Verify domain availability**
   - Check .com, .io, .app, .org extensions at namecheap.com or godaddy.com
   - Reserve domain immediately once decided to prevent squatting

2. **Trademark search**
   - Check USPTO database (uspto.gov)
   - Check EU trademark database if planning international use
   - Search Google Patents for any potential conflicts

3. **User testing**
   - Test top 2-3 names with target audience (researchers, academics, students)
   - Get feedback on memorability and professional perception

4. **Social media availability**
   - Check GitHub, Twitter/X, LinkedIn username availability
   - Consider consistency across platforms

5. **SEO considerations**
   - Unique names rank better in search results
