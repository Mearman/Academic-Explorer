# Reference Materials: E2E Test Coverage Enhancement

**Purpose**: This directory contains supplementary research materials generated during Phase 0 (Research) of the E2E Test Coverage Enhancement feature. These documents provide additional context and implementation details beyond what's captured in the primary design documents.

**Primary Design Documents** (use these first):
- `../research.md` - Consolidated research findings with decisions and rationale
- `../plan.md` - Implementation plan with technical context
- `../contracts/` - Page object, test helper, and data model interface contracts
- `../quickstart.md` - Test execution and development guide
- `../tasks.md` - Task breakdown for implementation

**Reference Materials** (supplementary detail):
- `playwright-research.md` - Playwright organization, configuration, and migration guides
- `page-objects.md` - Detailed page object pattern documentation
- `qa-automation.md` - QA automation framework and decision-making resources

## Files in Reference Directory

### playwright-research.md (Consolidated)

Comprehensive Playwright research including:
- Test organization patterns and best practices
- Key decisions made for test organization
- Configuration templates and examples
- Migration checklist for existing tests

**Key Findings**:
- Feature-based organization chosen over route-based
- Serial execution required (maxConcurrency: 1) to prevent OOM errors
- Hash routing pattern (`/#/route`) for TanStack Router
- Deterministic waits (app-ready checks) instead of networkidle

### page-objects.md (Consolidated)

Detailed page object pattern documentation including:
- Comprehensive page object pattern documentation
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Concrete implementation examples
- Decision matrix for choosing patterns
- Index of all page object interfaces
- Quick start guide

**Key Findings**:
- Hierarchical 4-layer pattern chosen: BasePageObject → BaseSPAPageObject → BaseEntityPageObject → Specific
- Dependency injection via constructor/factory pattern
- Clear separation of concerns (navigation, assertion, data access)
- Type-safe interfaces defined in `../contracts/page-objects.ts`

### qa-automation.md (Consolidated)

QA automation framework documentation including:
- Overview of QA automation framework
- Decision framework for test automation
- Quick reference guide
- Action plan for test automation triage
- Decision flowchart for test automation decisions

**Key Findings**:
- ROI formula: (Impact × Frequency × Speed) - Maintenance
- Automation threshold: ROI score > 15
- Manual tests worth keeping for exploratory testing
- Used for User Story 4 (Manual Test Automation) decision-making

### 2025-11-09-e2e-fix-summary.md

Summary of E2E test fixes from November 2025. Temporary file documenting test stabilization work.

### RESEARCH_DELIVERABLES.md

Summary of all research deliverables and their locations. Created during Phase 0 to track research agent outputs.

## How to Use These Materials

**For Implementation**:
1. Start with primary design documents (`../research.md`, `../plan.md`, `../contracts/`)
2. Refer to reference materials for deeper implementation details
3. Use quickstart.md for running tests and development workflow

**For Understanding Decisions**:
1. Check `../research.md` for high-level decisions and rationale
2. Dive into consolidated reference files for detailed justifications
3. Decision matrices and flowcharts provide tradeoff analysis

**For Examples**:
1. Page object examples: See `page-objects.md`
2. Configuration examples: See `playwright-research.md`
3. Quick starts: Each consolidated file includes quick start sections

## Consolidation History

**2025-11-23 (Phase 1)**: Initial consolidation
- Moved 17 scattered files from repo root and `/docs/` into organized subdirectories
- Created `playwright-research/`, `page-objects/`, `qa-automation/` subdirectories

**2025-11-23 (Phase 2)**: Further consolidation (Option B - Moderate)
- Merged 4 `playwright-research/*.md` → `playwright-research.md`
- Merged 7 `page-objects/*.md` → `page-objects.md`
- Merged 5 `qa-automation/*.md` + 1 `.txt` → `qa-automation.md`
- Removed subdirectories after consolidation
- **Result**: 20 files → 6 files (70% reduction)

## Archival Note

These materials were generated by specialized research agents during Phase 0 (Research) of the `/speckit.plan` workflow. They were initially scattered across the repository root and `/docs/` directory, then organized into subdirectories, and finally consolidated into single files per topic area.

The primary design documents (`research.md`, `plan.md`, `contracts/`, etc.) contain the essential information extracted from these reference materials. Use reference materials only when you need additional depth or examples beyond what's in the primary documents.

**Phase**: Phase 0 (Research) - Completed
**Status**: Reference materials consolidated (20 files → 6 files)
**File Count**: 6 files (3 consolidated research docs + 3 metadata docs)
